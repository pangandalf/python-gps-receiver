Sample data can be downloaded from [gnss-sdr](https://github.com/gnss-sdr/gnss-sdr) project page on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnss-sdr/files/data/). Alternatively, you can use the following command in your terminal:<br/>
```bash
wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnss-sdr/files/data/2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz
```
If the estimated download time is too long, you can also download the data using Google Colab and then copy it to your Google Drive after mounting the drive in Colab Notebook.

Then unpack the archive:
```bash
tar -zxvf 2013_04_04_GNSS_SIGNAL_at_CTTC_SPAIN.tar.gz
```
